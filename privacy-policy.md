We would also like to be very clear about the purposes of collecting the data.

- We create user profiles in order to allow analysis history to be attached to an account.
- Passwords allow users access to their accounts.
- E-mail addresses work as unique tokens for login access.
- Images and image history are retained in order to allow users to view analysis history.

In order to process your data, we must first obtain your consent via the in-app pop ups. You may remove your consent by contacting us at any time: [frances.arroyolopez@students.plymouth.ac.uk](mailto:frances.arroyolopez@students.plymouth.ac.uk). Deleting your account also removes your data.

You have the right to the data being correct. You may edit your account information at any time.

The above does not affect your statutory rights. You may exercise any rights not expressly stated in this privacy policy at any time by e-mailing us at [frances.arroyolopez@students.plymouth.ac.uk](mailto:frances.arroyolopez@students.plymouth.ac.uk).
